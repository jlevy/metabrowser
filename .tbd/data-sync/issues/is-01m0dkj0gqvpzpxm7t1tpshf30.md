Implement GitRevisionSubject and GitTreeSource over a shared RepositoryStoreTarget and an opaque SourceSession. Define byte-segment GitPath identity and URL/display serialization; enumerate NUL-framed trees with stable byte ordering; read blobs through exclusive actor-style cat-file batch readers that issue info before contents, enforce size gates, drain frames, and poison/restart on cancellation or framing failure. Migrate history, repo discovery, commit detail, refs, diffs, file/raw/container/classification/KPress routes, and built-in sidekicks to exact target plus subject OID semantics. Protect live OIDs with cross-process shared maintenance locks and durable private refs; GC/repack takes the exclusive lock. Add crash/stale-lock recovery, promisor-miss, oversized-blob, invalid-UTF8/newline-name, and two-process/two-OID tests. Never create a checkout, index, branch, worktree, or fake filesystem fact.

## Notes

CI 7-green on #157–#167. #168 stacked on #167: GitPath agent-log JSONL + adapter classify_identity. Do not close or merge. Do not serve acquired Git. Remaining: inventory open, archive containers, plugin classification from bytes (frontmatter/content keys).
