Implement GitRevisionSubject and GitTreeSource over a shared RepositoryStoreTarget and an opaque SourceSession. Define byte-segment GitPath identity and URL/display serialization; enumerate NUL-framed trees with stable byte ordering; read blobs through exclusive actor-style cat-file batch readers that issue info before contents, enforce size gates, drain frames, and poison/restart on cancellation or framing failure. Migrate history, repo discovery, commit detail, refs, diffs, file/raw/container/classification/KPress routes, and built-in sidekicks to exact target plus subject OID semantics. Protect live OIDs with cross-process shared maintenance locks and durable private refs; GC/repack takes the exclusive lock. Add crash/stale-lock recovery, promisor-miss, oversized-blob, invalid-UTF8/newline-name, and two-process/two-OID tests. Never create a checkout, index, branch, worktree, or fake filesystem fact.

## Notes

Stacked #195 (1f2b10e4) Git markdown /api/file frontmatter + frontmatter_error and KPress parse on #194. #193 7-green on b60318d3. #194 CI still in progress. Remaining later: inventory coordinator open, archive containers (mb-380k), serving acquired Git (mb-ew38), CLI --show of a Git pin. Possible next: Git text highlight_disabled / preview-window parity. Do not close mb-z335. Do not merge.
