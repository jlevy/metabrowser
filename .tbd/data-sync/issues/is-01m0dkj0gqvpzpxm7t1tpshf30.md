Implement GitRevisionSubject and GitTreeSource over a shared RepositoryStoreTarget and an opaque SourceSession. Define byte-segment GitPath identity and URL/display serialization; enumerate NUL-framed trees with stable byte ordering; read blobs through exclusive actor-style cat-file batch readers that issue info before contents, enforce size gates, drain frames, and poison/restart on cancellation or framing failure. Migrate history, repo discovery, commit detail, refs, diffs, file/raw/container/classification/KPress routes, and built-in sidekicks to exact target plus subject OID semantics. Protect live OIDs with cross-process shared maintenance locks and durable private refs; GC/repack takes the exclusive lock. Add crash/stale-lock recovery, promisor-miss, oversized-blob, invalid-UTF8/newline-name, and two-process/two-OID tests. Never create a checkout, index, branch, worktree, or fake filesystem fact.

## Notes

Further collapsed to 3 git phases on #156: #211 source+content, #212 view+SPA, #213 index+filters+chrome (db141a57). Cache 1B-a is #208+#210 on #140. HTML trust is #209 on main. Closed #141-#155 and #200-#206. #156 retargeted onto cache-cli-hygiene. Do not close mb-z335. Do not merge.
