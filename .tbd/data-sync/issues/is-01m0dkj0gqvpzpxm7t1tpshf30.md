Implement GitRevisionSubject and GitTreeSource over a shared RepositoryStoreTarget and an opaque SourceSession. Define byte-segment GitPath identity and URL/display serialization; enumerate NUL-framed trees with stable byte ordering; read blobs through exclusive actor-style cat-file batch readers that issue info before contents, enforce size gates, drain frames, and poison/restart on cancellation or framing failure. Migrate history, repo discovery, commit detail, refs, diffs, file/raw/container/classification/KPress routes, and built-in sidekicks to exact target plus subject OID semantics. Protect live OIDs with cross-process shared maintenance locks and durable private refs; GC/repack takes the exclusive lock. Add crash/stale-lock recovery, promisor-miss, oversized-blob, invalid-UTF8/newline-name, and two-process/two-OID tests. Never create a checkout, index, branch, worktree, or fake filesystem fact.

## Notes

CI 7-green on first slice #157 at b33e23f3. Second slice stacked as draft #158 on #157 (branch cursor/v011-revision-lease-bd04, commit b2dd406b): lease_revision + durable refs/metabrowser/subjects/<oid> + two-process tests. Do not close or merge. Remaining: route migration, shared per-store reader pool, inventory open for Git subjects, production GC exclusive lock.
