Introduce RepositorySubject, SourceSession, ContentSource, SourceCapabilities, and AttachedFilesystemSubject with exactly one active subject per server/browser session. SourceSession owns subject identity, generation, content reader, navigation/index capability, and lease. Generalize coordinator, file/raw/tree/container/event routes, cache keys, and plugin dispatch without behavior change for filesystem roots. Add additive content-reader plugin APIs; keep resolve_path and served_root filesystem-only, capability-gate legacy hooks on non-filesystem sources, and define typed unsupported behavior for recency, ignore, watcher, activity, and mutation capabilities. Preserve exact-root containment, update every built-in consumer and parity row, and publish through mb-tsdc. GitRevisionSubject, GitPath, tree/blob reads, batch readers, and revision leases remain mb-z335.

## Notes

#156 kept as the named 1B-b source-boundary contract (not absorbed into acquire or Git). Head `cursor/v011-source-boundary-bd04` @ `19507616` (786+29 / 14 files / 1 commit). Intended parent is Phase 1B-a `cursor/v011-cache-acquire-cli-bd04` @ `b09c01e0` (same tree as #210). Live PR base is still #210 `cursor/v011-cache-cli-hygiene-bd04`; retarget and body rewrite need pull_requests=write (gh 403; ManagePullRequest missing). Do not close or merge.
