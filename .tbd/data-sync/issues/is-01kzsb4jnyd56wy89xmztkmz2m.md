Extend the one Git runner with core-constructed trusted command targets, version detection, stdin isolation, non-interactive environment, and bounded acquisition/background policies. Acquire into an isolated worktree-free staging repository; record source, closed non-secret FetchAuthorizationContext kind, fetch-policy version, exact refspec, expected OID, object format, and base generation; validate before importing objects and CAS-publishing only Metabrowser-owned refs. Unknown SSH or credential-helper principals receive fresh unshareable contexts. Publish the validated immutable store first and the source alias as the sole visibility commit, with source-alias locking and crash reclamation for orphaned stores. Define deterministic provider-identity store derivation without a mutable provider-to-store pointer, but keep GitHub metadata, immutable tree serving, shared origins, checkouts, and indexes out of this bead.

## Notes

From mb-xa0p: acquisition must create and write the application home only through src/metabrowser/home.py (ensure_private_directory, open_private_file) before any network work, so symlinked, foreign-owned, or permissive ancestors are refused. home.py does not check Git's own files inside repository.git/ individually: set core.sharedRepository=0600 on created stores or rely on the enclosing 0700 directory, and test that no store file is created group- or world-readable.
