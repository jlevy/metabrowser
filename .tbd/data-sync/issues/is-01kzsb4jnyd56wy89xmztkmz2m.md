Extend the one Git runner with trusted command targets, version detection, stdin isolation, non-interactive environment, and bounded acquisition/background policies. Acquire a worktree-free Git database in owner-only staging, resolve and validate the default full OID and strict source/store records, then publish atomically with no replacement. Do not create a checkout or index. Acquisition integrity uses objects, refs, records, and leases rather than Git-status is_clean. Keep GitHub, provider metadata, and serving out of this bead.
