After explicit approval and after every publication bead records a green formal PR, land and retarget the v0.11 stack in dependency order: Phase 0A, 0B.1, 0B.2, 0B.3, 0C.1, 0C.2, shared repository/provider mirror design, Hosted Review 0D, repository Phase 1A, worktree-free acquisition, content-source boundary, immutable Git-tree source, untrusted-content profile, URL open, provider-job and selected-ref foundation, selected branch, provider foundation, direct PR cache, direct PR view, PR index/navigation, and anchors. Retarget each next PR to its landed base, inspect the exact new-base through HEAD diff, resolve only stacking conflicts, rerun make verify, obtain final green CI, and confirm main contains each layer. This is the sole landing owner; it never blocks constructing a later stack layer and never merges without explicit user approval.

## Notes

2026-09-19 restack (no landing): GitHub stack #131 unstacked. New stack #218 is #125 → #134 (folded #130 #132 #133) → #136 (folded #135) → #139 (folded #138) → #140 → #217 → #216 (folded #156). Closed extras with pointer comments. Landing still requires explicit approval.
