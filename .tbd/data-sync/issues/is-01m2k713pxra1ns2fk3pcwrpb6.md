After explicit approval and after every publication bead records a green formal PR, land and retarget the v0.11 stack in dependency order: Phase 0A, 0B.1, 0B.2, 0B.3, 0C.1, 0C.2, shared repository/provider mirror design, Hosted Review 0D, repository Phase 1A, worktree-free acquisition, content-source boundary, immutable Git-tree source, untrusted-content profile, URL open, provider-job and selected-ref foundation, selected branch, provider foundation, direct PR cache, direct PR view, PR index/navigation, and anchors. Retarget each next PR to its landed base, inspect the exact new-base through HEAD diff, resolve only stacking conflicts, rerun make verify, obtain final green CI, and confirm main contains each layer. This is the sole landing owner; it never blocks constructing a later stack layer and never merges without explicit user approval.

## Notes

Do not merge. Do not imply landed.

GitHub stack #218: https://github.com/jlevy/metabrowser/stack/218
#125 → #134 (folded #130 #132 #133) → #136 (folded #135) → #139 (folded #138) → #140 → #217 (folds #208 #210) → #216 (folds #156 and #211–#215).

#140 Bugbot Mediums fixed in da73b878; both threads resolved.
#125 is 2 commits behind origin/main (#137 tbd 0.9.0). Internally consistent; do not restack unless asked.
#217 and #216 are drafts. #216 is large (~101 files).

Landing still requires explicit human approval, then bottom-to-top gh stack merge.

2026-09-20: an independent re-review found #217 and #216 not yet landable; stabilization is tracked in mb-gacf. #207 merged; the stack needs a restack onto main.

2026-09-20: scope narrowed by user decision to the current stack #125 → #134 → #136 → #139 → #140 → #217 → #216 plus PR #209, which lands before #217; later phases are owned by mb-nhky.
The nine future-phase review blockers (mb-innz, mb-9aku, mb-k7lc, mb-cpco, mb-bue2, mb-79sz, mb-r596, mb-mx8q, mb-bf94) moved to mb-nhky, which is also blocked by this bead. mb-gacf was added as a blocker here. Remaining open blockers on this bead: mb-hoae, mb-k900, mb-tsdc, mb-d658, mb-gacf.

2026-09-22 reconciliation: v0.11.0 is released; this is the v0.12 stack. Live GitHub Stack 218 has exact chain #125(ed370a4e) -> #134(10990158) -> #136(e0b713b3) -> #139(4e189c9b) -> #140(93f19061) -> #217(4d25dc9a, draft) -> #216(b3c001a9, draft), all seven checks green per layer. User directs future testing, stabilization, and feature PRs to extend the same stack; hold the whole stack for stabilization and explicit landing approval. mb-nhky coordinates later phase publication but no longer means a separate landing batch. Remaining direct review blockers: mb-k900, mb-tsdc, mb-hoae, mb-gacf. HTML trust mb-d658 is closed and on main through #209, with later hardening inherited through #224. Alpha acceptance is docs/project/specs/active/plan-2026-09-22-v012-alpha-testing.md; no merge or release authorized by this audit.
